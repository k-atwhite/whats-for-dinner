# What's for Dinner?

## Project Overview
Project Goals:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

In this project, I had the opportunity to build a small website from a comp. Using HMTL,CSS, and JavaScript, I built the page's framework, style, and functionality. 
The hungry user can select a course or entire meal, click "Let's Cook!"and receive a suggested course from connected arrays containing dozens of options.

## How to use the app
### [View in your browser](https://k-atwhite.github.io/whats-for-dinner/)

Entering this website will take you to our homepage. Here, you can choose the course you're looking to make: sides dishes, main dishes, deserts, and even all three with the option entire meal.

Once you select your course, go ahead and press the "Let's Cook!" button underneath your selection.

You'll see displayed on the right a randomly selected course, or in the below example, and entire meal of randomly selected courses. You can keep cooking "Let's Cook!" to continue displaying random courses until you find one that inspires you.

If you would like to start over from a clean slate - press the clear button, which will remove the random course and bring back the image of a cookpot.
